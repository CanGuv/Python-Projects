# Mathematical Explorations in Python

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks exploring various mathematical concepts using Python. The notebooks demonstrate practical implementations and visualisations of mathematical principles across algebra, calculus, and data visualisation.

##  Contents

1. **Algebra.ipynb**  
   - Covers foundational algebraic concepts.  
   - Implements solutions to equations and inequalities.  
   - Explores functions, polynomials, and factorisation.

2. **Calculus.ipynb**  
   - Explores differential and integral calculus concepts.  
   - Includes examples of limits, derivatives, and integrals.  
   - Demonstrates symbolic computation using libraries like `SymPy`.

3. **Graphing and Visualisation.ipynb**  
   - Focuses on plotting and visualizing mathematical data.  
   - Utilises libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
   - Provides visual insights into algebraic and calculus-based functions.

## Requirements
